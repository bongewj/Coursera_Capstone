I aim to combine check-in information from Foursquare for businesses in each neighborhood in Singapore with the Resident Household data (e.g. distribution by type of dwelling in each neighborhood, household size, age, household income) from the Department of Statistics Singapore to identify neighborhoods that are most similar to Tampines (or the particular neighborhood under consideration) and predict what types of businesses could be underserved.
